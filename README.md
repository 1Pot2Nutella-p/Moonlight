#### About this project

Moonlight is a new game server hosting panel, using Blazor Server Side and Bootstrap.
It has been created as a private game panel for Endelon Hosting and split into a independend project. Because we never planned to make it open source, the documentation is lacking, but feel free to help us with it ^^

#### Features:

- Host all sorts of docker based game servers
  - Console
  - File Manager
  - Backups
  - Server type specific settings
- Create and manage websites using cloud panel
- Subdomain manager using the cloudflare api
- And many more
